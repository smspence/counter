This serves as an example project for how to create a simple standalone app for Android Wear 2.0.  The app also provides data to Android Wear 2.0 complications, and demonstrates how to set up complication tap actions.

[Download the app here on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buoybit.smspence.counter)
